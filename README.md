# Pixel Weather

Pixel Weather is a minimal, simplistic and nostalgic weather app, built with [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/) and [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).

On start, the app asks for user's current location. If granted, the app will fetch and display weather data for that location. Users can tap each stat to see corresponding weather forecasts.
